I'm a Full Stack developer who's played around with React, Angular, React-Native, SASS, NodeJS, Express, SQL, MongoDB and a bunch of other technologies.

#### I'm currently working on:
- [Feedbackr](https://github.com/RushabhM2/feedbackr) - An open source web application to help teachers with their transition to online teaching. A few friends of mine mentioned that creating assignment material is quite tedious. Wouldn't it be great if teachers across the world could create, share and use each others material to improve how they teach?

- [IndieClass](https://github.com/chamley/indieclass) - A mobile app that's built for people find cool and interesting classes and experiences hosted by other members of the app.

Please do reach out if you'd like to contribute to Feedbackr, or just have a tech friendly chat. ✌️
